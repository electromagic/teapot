# Teapot

Teapot is a decentralised build tool for managing complex cross-platform projects. It has many goals but it is primarily designed to improve the experience for developers trying to make cross-platform applications and libraries with a minimum of overhead.

- Provide useful feedback when dependencies are not met or errors are encountered.
- Decentralised dependency management allows use within private organisations without exposing code.
- Generators can simplify the construction of new projects as well as assist with the development of existing ones.
- The build subsystem provides a simple set of canonical operations for building libraries and executables to minimise configuration overhead.

## Installation

Ensure that you already have a working install of Ruby 1.9.3+

    $ gem install teapot

## Usage

Teapot doesn't have a centralised package management system. As such, this example shows how to use an existing open source framework.

Firstly, create your project by running:

	$ teapot create "My Project" https://github.com/dream-framework project
	$ cd my-project

You will be asked to merge the project file. At present, merge tools are not very good and thus you may need to take a moment to review the changes. You want to keep most of the original file, but you would like to add the `define_target` blocks which are being added.

In the resulting project directory that has been created, you can see the list of dependencies:

	$ teapot list

To build your project:

	$ teapot build Application/MyProject variant-debug

When you build, you need to specify dependencies. If you haven't specified all dependencies, they will be suggested to you.

The resulting libraries will be framework dependent, but are typically located in

	$ cd teapot/$PROJECT_NAME/platforms/$PLATFORM_NAME/bin/
	$ ./$PROJECT_NAME

### Example: Compiling TaggedFormat

For Linux (requires `clang-3.2` and `libstdc++-4.8`):

	$ teapot create "Local Tagged Format" https://github.com/dream-framework platform-linux variants tagged-format
	$ cd local-tagged-format
	$ teapot build Library/TaggedFormat variant-debug

For Mac OS X (requires Xcode Command Line Tools):
	
	$ teapot create "Local Tagged Format" https://github.com/dream-framework platform-darwin-osx variants tagged-format
	$ cd local-tagged-format
	$ teapot build Library/TaggedFormat variant-debug

You need to make sure any basic tools, e.g. compilers, system libraries, are installed correctly before building. Consult the platform and library documentation for any dependencies.

## Dependency Graph

Dependency analysis is an important part of efficiently building a source tree. A dependency graph constructed from a single output file depends on the set of input files and their associated implicit dependencies (e.g. `#include` directives), and additionally the environment and task that is being performed. Specifically, the environment can specify additional header files, libraries, or other dependent input files and needs to be considered explicitly.

Teapot assumes per-environment dependency graphs and in addition, parts of the dependency graph are generated dynamically. The process of extracting implicit dependencies can be found under `teapot/extractors` and is used extensively in the build graph `teapot/build`.
